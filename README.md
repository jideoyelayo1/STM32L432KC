<h1>STM32L432KC Microcontroller Emulator</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
The STM32L432KC Microcontroller emulator is a software-based emulator that aims to assist students in the University of Warwick's School of Engineering in learning how to use the physical microcontroller. The COVID-19 outbreak and restrictions on physical contact have made it difficult for students to obtain the necessary resources to learn about microcontrollers. This emulator is designed to overcome this obstacle and provide a method for emulating microcontrollers using software. This README file provides instructions on how to use the emulator and the features it provides.

<h2>Installation:</h2>
To use the emulator, download the latest release from the GitHub repository. The emulator is built using C# and .Net Framework 4.8, so you must have .Net Framework 4.8 installed on your computer. Once the installation is complete, you can run the emulator by double-clicking on the executable file.

<h2>Usage:</h2>
The emulator provides a simple user interface that allows you to interact with the microcontroller. The user interface includes registers and memory values, which can be modified to perform different operations. The emulator also provides GPIO outputs, LED lights, buttons, and PWMs to help with the education of microcontrollers.

<h2>Features:</h2> 

* Provides a simple user interface to interact with the microcontroller.
* Allows modification of registers and memory values.
* Provides GPIO outputs, LED lights, buttons, and PWMs to assist in learning.
* Supports emulation of the STM32L432KC microcontroller.
* Runs on Windows operating system.
* Built using C# and .Net Framework 4.8.

<h2>Implemented instructions:</h2>
The STM32L432KC Emulator project aims to facilitate the education of electronics by emulating the STM32L432KC system. The project provides added addressing nodes, including direct addressing mode and indirect addressing mode. 
It also includes a set of instructions such as: LDR, LDRB, ORR, STR, STRB, MOV, MOVS, MOVT, BIC, MOVW, AND, EOR, ORN, CMP, LSL, LSR, CBNZ, VMRS, VMSR, and branches such as BPL, BMI, BEQ, BNE, BGT, BLT, BX, B, SUB, ADD, ASR, ACR, and CLZ. 
These instructions and addressing nodes can be used to emulate the STM32L432KC system, making it easier for learners to understand the concepts of electronics.
